## Set by Step Plan

1. Prepare Your Curriculum Content
   Format Data: Organize your curriculum content into a structured format. You can use a simple text format or JSON.

2. Set Up OpenAI API Access
   Sign Up: If you don’t have an OpenAI account, sign up at OpenAI.
   Get API Key: After signing up, go to the API section and generate an API key. You’ll need this for accessing GPT-3.

3. Access OpenAI GPT-3 Playground
   Visit Playground: Go to the OpenAI Playground.
   Log In: Use your OpenAI account credentials to log in.

4. Set Up Your Playground Environment
   Choose Model: Select the text-davinci-003 or the latest model available for the best performance.
   Input Curriculum: In the Playground’s text area, format your prompt to include your curriculum content and a sample question.

5. Generate Responses
   Run Queries: Test different questions in the Playground to see how GPT-3 responds. Adjust your prompt if necessary to improve the accuracy of responses.
   Refine Prompts: If GPT-3 isn’t providing the correct answers, refine your prompt or provide more context.

6. Create a Basic Web Interface (Optional)
   HTML/CSS Setup: Create a simple HTML page to interact with GPT-3.

7. Deploy and Test
   Deploy: If you created a web interface, deploy it using a simple hosting service like GitHub Pages or Netlify.
   Test: Test the chatbot with various questions to ensure it’s functioning correctly.

8. Prepare Your Presentation
   Demo: Prepare a live demo of your chatbot.
   Explain: Outline how GPT-3 processes and responds to queries based on your bootcamp curriculum.
